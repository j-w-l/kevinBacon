# Kevin Bacon
Utilizes BFS-related methods to implement the Bacon game.

## Execution
Simply run Bacon.java's main method. (Note: you may need to rename the pathnames of testfiles, depending on where you place them.)

## Overview
This project tackles the important social network problem of finding an actor's "Bacon number." Starting with an actor, see if they have been in a movie with someone who has been in a movie with someone who has been in a movie...who has been in a movie with Kevin Bacon. They're usually at most 6 steps away. Here, the vertices are actors and the edge relationship is "appeared together in a movie." The computational problem is to find the shortest path between two actors.
